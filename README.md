# Funky carpet

This is an attempt of making a carpet extention. It works, but also doesn't work.
I made this to get carefulBreak, since there was only a 1.18 version when i made this. CarefulBreak is when you sneak and mine a block, it goes directly in your inventory.
Like i said, this works. CarefulBreak works as intended. But it also doesn't work, since there isn't an option for it in the carpet options...

## Credit
**BIG** credit to ``skyrising`` for making an exelent way of doing this for quick carpet, which is where i stole the code... So i will not take any credit for this, since its basicly a paste of skyrising's code.

## Download
If you dare to download this, there is a jar under the releases section :)
